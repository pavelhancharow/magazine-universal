          Guys, I don't want to jinx anything, but I think the 2020 NFL season is actually going to happen.
          The first game of the year is now just days away, and unless this country comes under attack by fire-breathing
          hornets between now and Thursday - which does seem at least somewhat plausible based on how the year has gone
          so far - I'm thinking we're going to get football.
          With the start of the NFL season now here, that means it's time for everyone's favorite thing: PREDICTIONS. I
          mean, one team has a 41-year-old player on its practice squad in case you're wondering how bizarre things have
          gotten this year.

        <h3 class="paragraph-geography__title">Predicting the record for every NFL team</h3>
        <p class="paragraph-text">
          I'll be honest, I have high expectations for my predictions this year and that's mainly because I've been
          locked in my house for the past five months quarantined with a baby. During that period, the only two things
          I've done are: 1. Change diapers and 2. Try to figure out who's going to win this year's Super Bowl. Although
          I'd like to think I'll hit the nail on the head with all of my predictions this year, the fact of the matter
          is that this could end up being one of the most unpredictable years in NFL history. Not only was the preseason
          eliminated, but NFL teams did their best to shut down the flow of information coming out of their training
          camps, which means I have no idea which rookies have looked good or if any aging veterans look like they
          should be thinking about retirement.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-text">
          Before we get to my predictions, let me explain how things are going to work here: I'm going to go through
          each division and predict each team's final record. After that, I'll be making a bold prediction for each
          division. Once you roll through the divisional portion of these predictions, you'll see my playoff picks and
          eventually, my Super Bowl champion. In two of the past five years, my preseason Super Bowl pick has ended up
          winning it all, so you might want to scroll down and check out that prediction first to see if I'm picking
          your favorite team.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-text">
          Also, since we all know that making fun of someone's predictions is half the fun of reading predictions, you
          can send all your hate tweets to me on Twitter by clicking here, and just so you know, Broncos fans, I'm
          already mentally preparing for your hate tweets.

          One of the toughest days of every football season comes the weekend before Week 1, as NFL teams are forced to
          reduce their rosters to 53 players. Most years, unheralded players are able to win spots in certain situations
          with standout performances in game situations, but thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, all preseason games were
          canceled this season, leaving those underdogs with less of a chance to make an impression.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-text paragraph-text__part2">Still, some players were able to use their practice time wisely
          and unseat more proven options on the depth chart. That includes in Green Bay, where Malik Turner won the last
          spot at receiver over Jake Kumerow, and in Pittsburgh, where Ray-Ray McCloud was able to beat out Ryan
          Switzer. Some moves caused us to scratch our heads, including the Raiders trading Lynn Bowden for a lower
          value than the third-round pick they spent on him in April, as well as the Cowboys reversing course on veteran
          safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix after signing him earlier this offseason. We'll have one takeaway from every team
          below, but you can also check out every single cut in our tracker from the weekend.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-text">The Bills spent a fifth-round pick on Jake Fromm in this year's draft with the hope
          that he could challenge for the backup spot at quarterback behind Josh Allen, but instead he found himself in
          a battle with Davis Webb to be the team's No. 3 option at the position. Speculation emerged that Fromm could
          fail to make the initial roster despite the draft pick invested in him back in April, but in the end it was
          Webb who found himself on the cut list. Buffalo did only keep four cornerbacks on the initial roster, so it's
          possible there are more moves on the way. One of those four, Tre'Davious White, also reportedly agreed to a
          massive extension on Saturday, keeping him in Buffalo for years to come.</p>

          The concept of ranking teams by overall strength isn't foreign to anyone; our Pete Prisco shares his rankings
          of all 32 teams every week of the regular season. Where power ratings for NFL bettors differ is that you must
          affix a point total to each team that signifies how far they are from an average team.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-text">
          First, pick the team you consider the 16th- or 17th-best in the NFL in 2020. If you go by the season win total
          market, that's someone in the Rams-Browns tier of teams (last year I used the 49ers and Ravens as our
          mid-level win total examples, so remember that these are just what the market is projecting at this moment).
          Assign whichever teams you think are average with a power rating of zero. From there, you'll assign point
          totals for each team that are better or worse than average, generally staying within the range of plus-5 and
          minus-5 at this point of the season, though I've made a few exceptions in my Week 1 ratings this year.

                It seems the only way car makers can get us to look at a new car and believe it might be slightly
                different from the iron on sale today is to always release photos with the obligatory camo. I am certain
                they actually invite photographers to come shoot the camo-clad mules to spice up their social media.

                    French Indochina was divided into five subdivisions: Tonkin, Annam, Cochinchina, Cambodia and Laos.
                    Cochinchina was the first territory under French Control. Saigon was conquired in 1859. Then, in
                    1887,
                    the Indochinese Union was established.
